I am a <b>Geographer</b> and MSc in <b>Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote sensing (RS)</b>. Now, I’m doing a Ph.D. in Remote Sensing applied to forests dynamics under global change at <b>Forest Planning and Landscape Analysis Lab </b> of the  {{< staticref "https://www.udl.cat" "newtab" >}}University of Lleida{{< /staticref >}} supported by University funding and projects.  I’m also involved in supporting spatial data curation and management from lab projects.

Raúl Hoffrén is a Ph.D candidate and FPU predoctoral researcher at the Department of Geography and Land Management from the University of Zaragoza. His research focuses on the estimation of the vertical structure of the vegetation in Mediterranean forests using multisensory remote sensing, specifically LiDAR in ALS, UAVs and satellites. He also does research on climatic micro-refugia for biodiversity in mountainous areas using thermal imageries and miniaturized field sensors.

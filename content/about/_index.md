The **core objective of FirePATHS** is to advance the understanding of the effects of climate change and, in particular, the role played by vegetation dynamics in the climate-vegetation-fire system and assessing the mitigation capacity of forest management. The project is structured around four interrelated objectives, each of which conforms a work package (WP):

1. Forecast vegetation dynamics under different climate change and forest management scenarios.

2. Characterize fuels and potential fire behavior.

3. Evaluate the probability of occurrence of extreme fires.

4. Determine the consequences of climate change and the scope of forest management proposals.

  This study explores the coupling of ignition models with initial attack success predictions to anticipate extreme wildfire events under future climate conditions. Presented at the EGU General Assembly 2024, the approach combines spatial ignition likelihood and firefighting efficiency modeling to identify potential high-impact wildfires.

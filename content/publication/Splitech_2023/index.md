abstract: |
  This study evaluates the likelihood of human-caused wildfire ignitions across Europe using a Random Forest model. Key drivers include proximity to roads, fuel types, and socio-environmental variables. The method was applied across several pilot sites in the FirEUrisk framework, identifying areas of elevated ignition probability for targeted fire prevention strategies.
